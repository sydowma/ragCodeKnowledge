## How It Works

The Code Search and Query System operates through several key steps:

1. **Code Parsing**
   - The system uses Tree-sitter, a parser generator tool and parsing library, to parse Java source files.
   - It traverses the directory structure recursively to find all `.java` files in the specified repository.
   - For each Java file:
     - The content is read and passed to the Tree-sitter parser.
     - The parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the structure of the code.
   - The system then extracts method and class declarations from the AST:
     - It looks for nodes of type 'method_declaration' and 'class_declaration'.
     - For each of these nodes, it extracts the corresponding source code snippet.

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - The extracted code snippets are processed using a SentenceTransformer model ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2').
   - This model converts each code snippet into a dense vector representation (embedding).
   - The embedding captures semantic information about the code, allowing for meaningful similarity comparisons.
   - Each code snippet is thus represented as a high-dimensional vector (typically 384 dimensions for the specified model).

3. **Indexing**
   - The system uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to create an efficient searchable index of the code embeddings.
   - It initializes a FAISS index using the IndexFlatL2 type, which performs exact L2 (Euclidean) distance calculations.
   - All the generated embeddings are added to this index.
   - The index allows for extremely fast similarity searches, even with a large number of code snippets.

4. **Query Processing**
   - When a user enters a query:
     - The query is converted into an embedding using the same SentenceTransformer model.
     - This query embedding is then used to search the FAISS index.
   - The system performs a k-nearest neighbors search (default k=5) to find the most similar code snippets.
   - The search returns the indices of the most similar snippets along with their distances from the query embedding.
   - The system then retrieves the original code snippets corresponding to these indices.

5. **Response Generation**
   - The system constructs a prompt for the Ollama language model:
     - It includes the user's original query.
     - It adds the retrieved relevant code snippets as context.
   - This prompt is sent to the Ollama API (running locally) for processing.
   - Ollama, based on the provided context and query, generates a detailed response.
   - This response typically includes explanations, interpretations, or suggestions based on the relevant code snippets and the user's query.

6. **Output**
   - The generated response from Ollama is then presented to the user.
   - This process combines the power of semantic search (finding relevant code) with the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of a large language model.

The system operates in a loop, allowing the user to make multiple queries in a single session. Each query goes through the same process of embedding generation, similarity search, and response generation, providing a dynamic and interactive code querying experience.
